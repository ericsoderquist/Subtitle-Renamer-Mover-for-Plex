### README: Subtitle Renamer & Mover for Plex

---

### Introduction

Welcome to the **Subtitle Renamer & Mover** tool! This handy tool is designed to help you organize your media files, especially when you're adding content to Plex Media Server. Plex requires subtitles to be in a specific format: the subtitle files must be in the same folder as the video files, and they need to be named exactly like the corresponding episode file, with the addition of a language code (e.g., `.en.srt` for English subtitles).

If you have a collection of media files where the subtitles are located in a separate subfolder and are not named correctly, this tool will make your life much easier by automatically renaming and moving the subtitle files to the correct location.

### What Does This Tool Do?

- **Renames Subtitles**: It renames subtitle files so they match the corresponding episode file name, followed by the correct language code.
- **Moves Subtitles**: It moves the renamed subtitle files from their subfolder to the main folder where the video files are located.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: It automatically detects and renames subtitles in many different languages.

### System Requirements

- **Python**: Youâ€™ll need to have Python installed on your computer to run this tool. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### How to Use This Tool

1. **Download the Script**: Save the script file as `subtitle_renamer.py` on your computer.

2. **Prepare Your Files**:
   - Make sure your media files are organized by seasons in separate folders (e.g., `Season 1`, `Season 2`, etc.).
   - Inside each season folder, you should have a `Subs` folder where the subtitle files are stored, with separate folders for each episode's subtitles.

3. **Install Python**:
   - If you donâ€™t already have Python installed, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Ensure Python is added to your systemâ€™s PATH during installation.

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac, or Linux).
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```
     cd path\to\your\script
     ```
   - Run the script by typing:
     ```
     python subtitle_renamer.py
     ```
   - A small window will open with a "Select Folder" button.

5. **Select Your Media Folder**:
   - Click the "Select Folder" button.
   - Navigate to the main folder where your media files are stored (the one containing all the season folders).
   - Click "OK" to start the process.

6. **Let the Tool Work**:
   - The tool will automatically rename and move the subtitle files for you.
   - Once itâ€™s done, youâ€™ll see a confirmation message.

7. **Check Your Files**:
   - Verify that the subtitles have been moved and renamed correctly in each season folder.
   - Your media files are now ready to be added to Plex with correctly formatted subtitles!

### Example

Letâ€™s say you have the following structure:

```
Show Name
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Season 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E01.mp4
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E02.mp4
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Subs
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E01
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2_eng.srt
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Show.S01E02
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ 2_fra.srt
```

After running the script, it will be reorganized to:

```
Show Name
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Season 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E01.mp4
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E01.en.srt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E02.mp4
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Show.S01E02.fr.srt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Subs (optional: this can be deleted after processing)
```

### Language Support

This tool supports a wide range of languages. Here are some examples of the supported language codes:

- **English**: `.en.srt`
- **French**: `.fr.srt`
- **Spanish**: `.es.srt`
- **German**: `.de.srt`
- **Chinese**: `.zh.srt`
- **Japanese**: `.ja.srt`
- **Korean**: `.ko.srt`
- **Russian**: `.ru.srt`
- **Arabic**: `.ar.srt`
- **Portuguese**: `.pt.srt`

And many more! The script automatically detects the language based on the file name and renames it accordingly.

### Troubleshooting

- **Python Not Found**: If you get an error that Python isnâ€™t recognized, make sure itâ€™s properly installed and added to your PATH.
- **Incorrect File Names**: Ensure your subtitles follow the expected naming convention with a three-letter language code (e.g., `2_eng.srt`). If the naming convention is different, the script might need adjustments.
- **Folders Not Selected**: If nothing happens after you select the folder, make sure you selected the correct main folder that contains all the season folders.
